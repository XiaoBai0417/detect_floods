# Demo for AI SAR-Based Flood Monitoring Using Google Earth Engine

This repository contains the example code accompanying our research on flood monitoring through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and Google Earth Engine (GEE). The provided code demonstrates the extraction of relevant satellite data, preprocessing steps, and the application of AI-based methods for detecting and monitoring flood events.

# Features
Google Earth Engine Data Access: Efficiently download Sentinel-1 SAR data and other relevant datasets for flood-prone regions.

AI-Powered Flood Detection: Automated identification and monitoring of flood areas using advanced machine learning techniques.

All-Weather Monitoring: Leveraging SAR dataâ€™s cloud-penetrating ability to detect floods even during adverse weather conditions.
